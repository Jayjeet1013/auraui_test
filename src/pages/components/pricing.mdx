# Pricing Elements

## Overview

A pricing section on a website is a dedicated area where the costs of products or services are displayed, often with detailed descriptions of what is included at each price point. This section helps potential customers understand the different pricing options, features, and benefits associated with each tier, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions.
