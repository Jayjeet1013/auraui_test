## What’s Aura UI?

Aura UI is your new best friend. Inspired by **Magic UI**, **Acertinity UI**, and **ShadCN UI**, we’ve mixed animated components with a ton of web elements like nav bars, footers, headers, hero sections, and more. Just find what you need, copy the code, and you’re set!

Our components look great and are easy to change. Switch colors, tweak layouts, add links—you can do it all.

### Cool Animations ✨

Want animations without the hassle? We’ve got you. Smooth, professional animations are just a copy-paste away.

## Who’s It For?

For developers who:
- Want to convert designs into code quickly.
- Are tired of repeating the same coding tasks.
